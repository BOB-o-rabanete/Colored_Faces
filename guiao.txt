1 -> instalation of libs
    importation of libs used

2 -> find df of faces
    get only faces from same sex and similar age group
    garantee classification of features (White, Black, Asian, ...)
    store them

3 -> find way to paint face   
    define the class/range of colors (r, g, b) -> c_palet

4 -> mass paint and classification code
    create a df(result_grid) with (foto_name, og_catgory, og_classified, c1_d_classification, ..., cn_l_classification)
        cn -> colour classification (red, orange, ...)
        l/d -> light or dark (if it is a darker or a lighter tone of cn)
    fclassify -> gets a foto, a facialrecognition model
            returns if recognized or not 
    
    f_general -> 
        for group in face_grous of fotos:
            for each color in c_palet:
                change the faces to new color
                store them
                for each model:
                    evaluate
                    add results to result_grid 
                discart changed faces 

    f_eval

5 -> evaluate
    analise the result_grid
    whicch colours faild the most
    if there are more fails on dark pr light overall
    LIGHTER VS DARKER
    COLOR BATLE

6 -> extra
    see if there is a way to evaluate/agregate nose, yey shape, lip shape
    per face in result_grid evaluate those:
        see which categories have the most faild cases in general, and per color
